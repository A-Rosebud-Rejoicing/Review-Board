# Overview

Is an overview really necessary? Maybe. 

In this day and age so many people need to look at something. It's like we all want something to read, but we've got to be given a reason to read it.

What I'm up to?

Alright. Sigh. 

I want to learn Haskell. It's a functional programming language and I think that it'll be a fun thing for me to give a shot.

Now. In knowing that I want to learn Haskell, I know that I need a good project.

I'm in the middle of selling my [books](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_ebooks_1?ie=UTF8&text=Yolanda++Paptie&search-alias=digital-text&field-author=Yolanda++Paptie&sort=relevancerank). As part of my marketing, I'd like to post reviews on my Facebook Page, Twitter, and maybe a few other social media outlets that I use. I don't know all of them.

When it comes to my hugo-explore blog, I don't really want the two to be in sync together. This is a seperate project that belongs to ME, Kalika Curry, even though I'm using the reviews to drive people to my websites, I'm mostly getting people to know me. Okay. I'm looking for content, I don't have enough content and I have a lot of things that I like to explore, so it seems as good idea as any to put them up there.

To start out I searched the internet for a good template for my review website. Then I stopped myself, remembering that I want to work with Haskell.

Nextup, I found a good excel template that's meant for tracking. I don't like that tool. It's too databasey, so that tells me, intuitively, that I'm on the right track with wanting to use Haskell.

Now, a long time ago. A really, really long time ago - like in 2013 or something. I was looking into Apache Stanbol and the IKS Project. The project idea started out witih a bartender application. I wanted to be able to tell the bartender that I want a purple beer and have the thing bring me back and Abita Purple Haze. It's just, that's a part of me - when I want an abita purple age, my brain thinks purple beer and doesn't always register the Abita Haze part. It does now, obviously, but it didn't when I conceived the application.

At any rate, that information from that previous paragraph was going to be placed into a MediaWiki and then transformed through ML/NLP/AI to get me that haze that I want.

I just never got around to figuring out how to make that happen.

Now. What does this mean? This just means that I'm creating a rating application that will track my tastes. 

The initial idea is that (if I go with Hakyll which will make my life easier), all I have to do is type up a webpage with the name of the place, the type of place, the number of stars, and my description or review and poof! It's all there. It looks a lot like OWL, IMO. 

But what do I know? I've only been thinking about this shit for five yeras now. 

At any rate, I'm building this rating system. I know I'm using AWS and it's either Hakyll or Haskell. I can't decide.

My gut is telling me to work with Haskell, my laziness, gumption, and experience is telling me to work with Hakyll. 

Which will prevail?

I don't know. I've got time. It's just a rating site.
